# Challenges

- Neal anticipates challenges with the statistical analysis of the data, as he didn't ever get past rudimentary statistics classes. He also is thinking about resource management with large quantities of data that we will be processing: we might have to use some resource management libraries if it looks like our dataset is exceedingly large -- technical challenges.
- Oliver feels confident about these things -- difference in comfort level.
- Neal and Oliver work in very different time zones and work schedules, necessitating mostly asynchronous collaboration -- logistical challenge.
