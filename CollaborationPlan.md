# Collaboration plan

We plan to use ASU's Microsoft OneDrive to collaborate as we write reports and use the benefits of the Microsoft Office
suite, discuss our work in a Slack channel that we've already established, and version control our software with git;
specifically, GitHub.

We will both be using the same branch for primary development, but may use branches where we want to keep that code
separate until it's time to merge. We both have push access to the remote, so no pull requests will be necessary.
