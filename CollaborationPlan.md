# Collaboration plan

We plan to use ASU's Microsoft OneDrive to collaborate as we write reports and use the benefits of the Microsoft Office suite, discuss our work in a Slack channel that we've already established, and version control our software with git; specifically, GitHub. 

We will both be using the same branch, at least until we get to the point where we're adding major nice-to-have features, where we want to keep that code separate until it's time to merge. We both have push access to the remote, so no pull requests will be necessary.
